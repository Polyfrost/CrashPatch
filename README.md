CrashPatch is a 1.8.9 modification port of the BetterCrashes Minecraft modification (1.7.10) which is a port of the VanillaFix Minecraft modification (1.12.2).

CrashPatch essentially wraps the game in a try-catch statement, which stops the game from closing when something goes wrong. (AKA a crash)

When CrashPatch detects a crash, it will exit the current world and display a screen where you can either return to playing the game, find solutions to the crash, or open/upload the crash log.

If Minecraft crashes while loading/initializing the game, it will not be able to recover but the ability to see possible solutions and/or open/upload crash logs will still be available.
